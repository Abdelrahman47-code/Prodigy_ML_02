## Customer Clustering with DBSCAN

## Overview:
This is the repo for my second task at the ML Virtual Internship from [Prodigy InfoTech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodigy-infotech/). This project demonstrates the application of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to cluster customers based on their features. The steps include data loading, exploration, visualization, clustering, and evaluation of the clustering results.

## Key Features:
- Data Exploration and Visualization:
- Gain insights into customer data through visualizations of feature distributions.
- Explore the spatial distribution of customer clusters in a 3D space, providing a unique perspective on their segmentation.
- Silhouette Score Evaluation:
- Assess the quality of clustering using the Silhouette score, a key metric for understanding the separation between clusters.
